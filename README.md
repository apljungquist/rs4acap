## Preview

The tools in this project are split into two categories:

- **Porcelain programs** combine one or more plumbing programs to make common workflows ergonomic.
  Because integrations change and break, porcelain is inherently more fragile than the plumbing it sits on.
  To prevent combinatorial growth of the test matrix, only a subset of the plumbing functionality is exposed.
- **Plumbing programs** each target a single integration.
  These are designed to be composable, robust, and to afford the user more flexibility than porcelain programs.

Note that some programs don't yet fit this model.
The biggest deviation is in `device-inventory`, which integrates with mDNS and the VLT in addition to its own database.
The status of `firmware-inventory` is also a bit murky as it integrates with an online service and its own database.

### Porcelain programs

#### `cli4a`

```console
$ cli4a help

Commands:
  upgrade      Upgrade the device to a firmware version matching a semver requirement
  completions  Generate shell completions
  help         Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help
```

### Plumbing programs

## Installation

The tools in this project can be installed using Cargo:

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/apljungquist/rs4a.git cli4a
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/apljungquist/rs4a.git device-finder
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/apljungquist/rs4a.git device-inventory
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/apljungquist/rs4a.git rs4a-device-manager
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/apljungquist/rs4a.git rs4a-firmware-inventory
```

If you want to install them another way, open an issue and I may be able to help.
